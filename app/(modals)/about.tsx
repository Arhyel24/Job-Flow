          About JobFlow
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          JobFlow is a smart and intuitive job application tracker designed to
          simplify and streamline the job search process. Built with a focus on
          usability and privacy, it helps users stay organized, motivated, and
          in control of their career journey.
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          With JobFlow, you can easily log new job applications, monitor their
          progress, and keep track of important milestones such as interviews,
          follow-ups, and outcomes â€” all in one central location, without the
          need for cluttered spreadsheets or scattered notes.
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          The app was created in response to the common frustration many job
          seekers face when managing multiple applications across different
          platforms. JobFlow brings everything together into a clean, focused
          experience that puts your job hunt at your fingertips.
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          JobFlow operates entirely offline with optional cloud backup to your
          own Google Drive. Your data remains yours, fully private and secure.
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>Version: 1.0.0</Text>
